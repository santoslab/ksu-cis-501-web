   <h3>CIS 501: Software Architecture and Design, Fall 2014</h3>

----

Objective and Topics
********************

You will learn about software engineering and software architectures:
how to read and write software blueprints,
how to convert blueprints into code, and
how to employ standard design patterns and software architectures in real systems.

Here is a list of topics to be covered:

1.  How to manipulate Visual Studio

2.  Software as "virtual reality"; classes and unit testing

3.  Classes and objects; storage layout; object diagrams

4.  Class diagrams and using Visual Studio to draw them

5.  Interfaces, abstract classes, and C# delegates

6.  Reactive-system architecture: entities, boundaries, controllers

7.  Coupling and coherence; software metrics

8.  Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and its variants (MVP and MVB)

9.  Use cases and use-case realization; communication and sequence diagrams

10. State diagrams and controller design

11. Multithreading and its implementation by C# threads and locks

12. Tiered ("3-tier") software architecture

13. Design patterns: behavioral, structural, and creational

14. Introduction to software architecture "theory"


Materials
*********

The :ref:`course-notes` are the main course materials. Other references will be
provided as the course unfolds.

Schedule
********

:Time: Tuedays & Thursdays, 2:30pm - 3:45pm 
:Place: 021 Nichols Hall

Format
******

Each class starts with a lecture for about 30-45 minutes,
followed by a lab exercise;
the exercise will be scored before the end of the class.

There will be about 3 programming homework and 2 design-implementation projects,
with about 2-3 times 1-on-1 design and code reviews with 
the instructor/graduate teaching assistant.
There will be two in-class exams, one scheduled mid-semester, and 
the other scheduled at the Finals Week exam time.

Grading
*******

At the end of the term, the points are totalled, and letter grades are assigned.
There are no fixed 90-80-70 cutoffs for the letter grades ---
a "curve" is calculated based on the difficulty of the course activities
(lab exercises, homeworks, projects, one-on-one meetings, and exams).
(If you score 90% or better, you are guaranteed an 'A', in any case.)

**Important:** if you want a 'C' or better from this course,
it is necessary for you to average at least 50% on the course exams.

Computer Access
***************

This course involves a lot of programming, and it makes significant use of 
software tools. 
Many of these can be accessed by you (for free) and installed on your own 
machine.
If you prefer, we have everything you need on our CIS department machines so you
can get an account on our machines.
See the :ref:`course-notes` for information on how to get an account and use our
machines.


Attendance Policy
*****************

In general, there will be NO make-up lab exercises or exams!
Special consideration will be given in only exceptional circumstances.
Exceptional circumstances are generally limited to:

* Emergencies: death in student's immediate family, or 
  near-death experience of the student.

* Non-emergencies: certified excused absences for official university activities.

If you believe you qualify for exceptional treatment, you must notify the
instructor prior to the date of the lab exercise or exam to be missed.

Statement Regarding Academic Honesty
************************************

Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity, which 
is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one's work is
performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. 
Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the Honor System.
The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time
students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus,
and via distance learning.
The honor system website can be reach via the following URL: 
http://www.ksu.edu/honor.

A component vital to the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which
applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by
students.
The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated:
"On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid
on this academic work."
A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty.
The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor
Pledge violation.

Other Administrative Issues
***************************

* **Incompletenes:** An incomplete (I) final grade will be given only by prior
  arrangement in exceptional circumstances conforming to departmental policy in
  which the bulk of course work has been completed in passing fashion.

* **Drop Policy:** It is your responsibility to drop the course if you are
  enrolled but decide not to complete the course --- there are no "automatic"
  drops due to nonattendance.
  The University allows a retake of a course with removal of the prior grade,
  at most once per course, for a maximum of five courses.
  
* **Students with Disabilities:** If you have any physical or learning
  disability which will make it difficult for you to carry out the work as
  I have outlined in this syllabus or which will require academic
  accommodations, please notify me the first two weeks of the course.

* **Harrassment:** One purpose of your education is to help you develop skills,
  approaches, and abilities that are necessary for effective teamwork, and for
  your success in your profession and as a citizen.
  It is important that you understand your rights and responsibilities regarding
  the University's Sexual and Racial Harassment policies (full text of the
  policies can be found on KSU's web site at
  http://www.ksu.edu/uauc/fhbook/fhxj.html).
  If you experience any situations, in or out of class, that seem inappropriate
  or that make you uncomfortable, a list of resources and courses of action to
  assist you can be found on the College of Engineering web site at
  http://www.engg.ksu.edu/harassment-statement.

* **Expectations for Classroom Conduct:** All student activities in the
  University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial
  Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Government Association By Laws,
  Article VI, Section 3, number 2.
  Students that engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be
  asked to leave the class.

* **Campus Safety:** Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe
  teaching and learning environment for student and faculty members.
  In order to enhance your safety in the unlikely case of a campus emergency
  make sure that you know where and how to quickly exit your classroom and how
  to follow any emergency directives.
  To view additional campus emergency information go to the University's main
  page, http://www.k-state.edu, and click on the Emergency Information button.

* **Copyright Issues:** Class and lecture notes for this course carry a
  copyright.
  Students are prohibited from selling (or being paid for taking) notes during
  this course to or by any person or commercial firm without the express written
  permission of the professor teaching this course.

For a more complete discussion of these issues see the course policies for the
College of Engineering at Kansas State University:
